# Smart Contracts Learning Journey

This repository is a collection of all the Solidity smart contracts I create during my learning journey. It serves as a personal portfolio documenting my progress from basic storage contracts to more complex patterns. Each contract is accompanied by explanations to help me track my growth and share my knowledge.

## Purpose

This repository is intended to:

- Document my learning process in Solidity and smart contract development.
- Provide a reference for the contracts I build and experiment with.
- Share my progress with others interested in blockchain development.
- Serve as a foundation for future, more advanced contracts like ERC-20 tokens, NFTs, and DeFi protocols.

## How to Use

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Use Remix, Hardhat, or Foundry to compile and deploy the contracts.
3. Experiment with modifying the code to deepen understanding.
4. Follow my progress as I add more complex contracts and features.
